# Snapshot testing

This folder contains programs that does not compile. The goal is to ensure that the compiler gives meaningful error messages.
To test error messages we use [parrot](https://github.com/CharlyCst/parrot), a tool that saves snapshots of the compiler outputs and compare them to new runs. Refer to the **parrot** repo readme for more information on how to use it.
