# The Fork language

This chapter is about introducing the Fork language. 

At the time of writing, Fork is only at version 0.1.0 and does not yet support memory allocation, only numbers and booleans can be manipuled but the language support all other basic features you probably expect, namely:

- Arithmetic, boolean and bit-level manipulation.
- Functions and control flow.
- Typing.
- Compiler errors (not yet perfect but hopefully helpul).
- A package system.

Without further waiting, let's get started writing Fork!
